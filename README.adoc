= Functional Tests of Groovy

These are tests that do things like `System.gc()`, spin up many threads, access internal fields of class and/or take
a long time to complete.

In order to run against master you'll need a clone of the groovy git repo.  You'll need to install in maven local repo,
this can be done running the following command in the groovy git repo directory:

`./gradlew install`

Tests that are associated with a particular JIRA issues can be found under the *issues* directory.  For some tests it
helps to adjust the available memory settings and/or set system properties, for example:

```
test {
    minHeapSize = '256m'
    maxHeapSize = '256m'
    systemProperty 'groovy.use.classvalue', 'true'
    jvmArgs '-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError'
}
```
